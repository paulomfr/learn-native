# Learn Native

In this project, I've been learning about the fundamentals of React Native.

- Getting started with Native
- Some React Native components (e.g FlatList, View, Text...)
- API request calls
- Screen navigation
- ...

The purpose here was very simple, just load a GitHub user and then when press in this user go to a new page and load your starred respositories.

For now, I'm going more deeper in the Native universe and learn more about Device APIs, and others stuffs.
